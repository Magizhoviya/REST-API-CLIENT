# TASK DESCRIPTION
Objective:

The objective of this task is to design and implement a REST API Client application that interacts with external web services using standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. The task aims to provide practical knowledge of how client applications communicate with RESTful APIs to send and receive data, making it a critical skill in modern web and software development.

Task Overview:

In this task, you will create a REST API Client that can perform the following operations on a given API endpoint:

GET Request:
Retrieve data from a REST API endpoint. For example, fetch a list of users, products, or posts and display them in a structured format (e.g., table or list).

POST Request:
Send new data to the server. This could be a new user registration, creating a new item, or submitting a form. The client must accept user input, format it as JSON, and post it to the API.

PUT Request:
Update an existing resource on the server. The client should allow the user to modify existing data by sending an updated JSON object to the appropriate endpoint.

DELETE Request:
Delete a specified resource by making a DELETE request to the API.

Features to Include:

Command-line or GUI-based menu to select operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Error handling and status code management (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).

Logging of request and response for debugging and traceability.

JSON parsing and response formatting using appropriate libraries (Gson, Jackson, or built-in tools).

Learning Outcomes:

By completing this task, you will:

Gain an understanding of the HTTP protocol and RESTful principles.

Learn how to make HTTP requests and handle responses in code.

Develop skills to parse JSON data and display it meaningfully.

Improve error handling and logging techniques for better debugging.

Build a solid foundation for developing backend and frontend integrations in real-world applications.

Tools and Technologies Required:

Programming language: Java (with HttpURLConnection, HttpClient, or external libraries like OkHttp), Python (requests), or JavaScript (fetch or axios)

JSON processing library (Gson, Jackson, or built-in alternatives)

API for testing: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com or any free public REST API

This task is vital for understanding how different components of modern web applications interact and is especially important for those aiming to become full-stack developers or backend engineers.
